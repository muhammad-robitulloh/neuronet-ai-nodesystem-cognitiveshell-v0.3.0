# NeuroNet Cognitive Shell v0.3.0

A semi-agentic AI terminal system that doesn't just run commands — it thinks, analyzes, and acts. Designed for modern developers, sysadmins, and thinkers who want an intelligent assistant inside their shell.

Built for environments as light as Termux and as flexible as Google Cloud Shell, this MVP is a step toward fully modular cognitive infrastructure for human-AI co-processing.

Integrated with:

✅ LLM inference via OpenRouter API

✅ Telegram command relay (remote terminal via bot)

✅ Real-time log monitoring + pattern-based error detection

✅ Auto-suggestion & auto-fix (optional execution)

✅ Designed with scalability in mind: future-ready for multi-agent node system
